## Ascii-art-fs Project

## Objectives
The objective of the ascii-art program is to receive a string as an argument and output the string in a graphic representation using ASCII characters. The program should be able to handle input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters, and line breaks (\n).
A graphic representation using ASCII characters means that the string will be written using ASCII characters to form a visual representation. Each character in the string will be represented by a series of ASCII characters, following a specific graphical template.

## Usage
To run the program, use the following command on Git Bash terminal:

```
go run . [STRING] [BANNER]
EX: go run . something standard
```

To run the Test File:

```
./Testing.sh
```
